# supermarket-sales-forecasting
This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast sales for a supermarket chain. By analyzing historical transaction data, the model identifies key factors—such as promotions, seasonality, and store location—that influence revenue. This helps store managers optimize inventory levels and reduce waste.
